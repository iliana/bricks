<h1>Glossary</h1>

<dl class="glossary">
  <dd id="opsplus">Adjusted OPS (OPS+)</dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="#ops">On-base plus slugging</a> normalized such that the league average batter has an OPS+ of 100. The
    formula is
    <span class="whitespace-nowrap">100&times;[(<a href="#obp">OBP</a>/lgOBP)+(<a href="#slg">SLG</a>/lgSLG)-1]</span>,
    where lgOBP and lgSLG are league averages for the season. Because the formula uses the league average on-base
    percentage and slugging percentage, rather than the league average on-base plus slugging, players can have
    significantly different on-base plus slugging but a similar adjusted OPS.
  </dt>

  <dd id="ab">At Bats (AB)</dd>
  <dt>
    A player’s total hits and outs (except sacrifice plays). This statistic does not include walks. See also
    <a href="#ba">batting average</a> and <a href="#slg">slugging percentage</a>.
  </dt>

  <dd id="bb">Bases on Balls / Walks (BB)</dd>
  <dt>
    A <a href="#pa">plate appearance</a> that ends due to the pitcher pitching (usually) four balls and the batter
    advancing to first base.
  </dt>

  <dd id="ba">Batting Average</dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="#h">Hits</a> divided by <a href="#pa">plate appearances</a>. A measure of how often a batter reaches base
    due to their influence, as this statistic does not include walks or sacrifice plays (however, the nature of a batter
    having “influence” on the immaterial plane is a subject for debate).
  </dt>

  <dd id="babip">Batting Average on Balls In Play (BABIP)</dd>
  <dt>
    A measure of how often a batter reaches base only on plays where the defense is involved. Home runs,
    <a href="#so">strikeouts</a>, and <a href="#sac">sacrifice flies</a> are removed from the standard
    <a href="#ba">batting average</a> calculation.
  </dt>

  <dd id="sb">Caught Stealing (CS)</dd>
  <dt>
    A runner put out by the defense while attempting to advance to the next base without the ball being hit into play.
    See also <a href="#sb">stolen bases</a>.
  </dt>

  <dd id="gidp">Double Plays Grounded Into (GIDP)</dd>
  <dt>Number of plate appearances that end in the batter and another runner being put out in the same play.</dt>

  <dd id="fc">Fielder’s Choice (FC)</dd>
  <dt>A play where the defense chooses to put a runner out at a further base rather than at first base.</dt>

  <dd id="g">Games Played (G)</dd>
  <dt>
    Number of games this player appeared in playing this position. (This currently double-counts players that played for
    both teams in the same game due to Feedback.)
  </dt>

  <dd id="h">Hits (H)</dd>
  <dt>
    A single, double (2B), triple (3B), or home run (HR). Runners reaching base on
    <a href="#fc">fielder’s choice</a> are not credited with a hit, as they merely replaced a runner put out on a
    further base.
  </dt>

  <dd id="obp">On-base Percentage (OBP)</dd>
  <dt>
    Times on base (<a href="#h">hits</a> plus <a href="#bb">walks</a>) divided by plate appearances (<a href="#ab"
      >at bats</a
    >
    plus <a href="#bb">walks</a> plus <a href="#sac">sacrifice flies</a>). A measure of how often a batter reaches base
    under any circumstances. Players that are walked more often will have a significantly higher on-base percentage than
    <a href="#ba">batting average</a>.
  </dt>

  <dd id="ops">On-base Plus Slugging (OPS)</dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="#obp">On-base percentage</a> plus <a href="#slg">slugging percentage</a>. Commonly used to measure the
    overall offensive performance of a player. See also <a href="#opsplus">adjusted OPS</a>.
  </dt>

  <dd id="pa">Plate Appearances (PA)</dd>
  <dt>
    A completed turn batting. Batters complete a turn when they are put out or become a runner. If a runner is caught
    stealing and ends the inning, the batter is not credited with a plate appearance.
  </dt>

  <dd id="rbi">Runs Batted In (RBI)</dd>
  <dt>Credited to a batter for a run scored due to the batter’s time at the plate (except for double plays).</dt>

  <dd id="r">Runs Scored or Allowed (R)</dd>
  <dt>
    A runner who crosses home plate is credited with a run. The pitcher that allowed this runner to reach base is
    charged with a run allowed. A team wins by scoring more runs than the opposing team.
  </dt>

  <dd id="sac">Sacrifice Flies (SF) / Sacrifice Hits (SH)</dd>
  <dt>
    A play that results in the batter being put out at first in order to allow another runner to reach home plate. A
    sacrifice fly differs in that runners must first touch their last base after a ball is caught for an out, then can
    run for home plate.
  </dt>

  <dd id="slg">Slugging Percentage (SLG)</dd>
  <dt>
    <a href="#tb">Total bases</a> divided by <a href="#ab">at bats</a>. A measure of how often a batter hits extra-base
    hits (doubles, triples, and home runs).
  </dt>

  <dd id="sb">Stolen Bases (SB)</dd>
  <dt>
    A runner safely advancing to the next base without the ball being hit into play. See also
    <a href="#cs">caught stealing</a>.
  </dt>

  <dd id="so">Strikeouts (SO)</dd>
  <dt>
    A <a href="#pa">plate appearance</a> that ends due to the pitcher pitching (usually) three strikes and putting the
    batter out.
  </dt>

  <dd id="tb">Total Bases (TB)</dd>
  <dt>
    The number of bases a player reaches on <a href="#h">hits</a>. Singles are 1 base, doubles are 2 bases, triples are
    3 bases, and home runs are (usually) 4 bases. See also <a href="#slg">slugging percentage</a>.
  </dt>
